# COMPLETE SOLUTION: F615 Utilities Auto-Selection ✅

## FINAL STATUS: RESOLVED
The utilities auto-selection functionality is fully operational with proper dashboard navigation.

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED
- **Problem**: System auto-created F617/F618 configurations instead of using F615
- **Cause**: Auto-creation logic triggered when accessing F615 without proper ID parameter
- **Solution**: Disabled auto-creation, forced all patching routes to F615 (id=615)

## COMPLETE FIXES APPLIED ✅
1. **Deleted Duplicate Configurations**: Removed F616, F617, F618 from database
2. **Disabled Auto-Creation**: Modified routing logic to prevent new configuration creation
3. **Fixed Dashboard Navigation**: All routes include both `id=615` and `autoSelectUtilities=true`
4. **Verified Selection Mechanism**: Manual testing confirmed utilities card selection works

## PROPER USAGE WORKFLOW
### Method 1: Dashboard Navigation (Automatic)
1. Go to dashboard with utilities report loaded

5. Utilities card auto-selects with blue background and settings icon

### Method 2: Manual Selection (Alternative)
1. Access F615 directly
2. Manually click the utilities card to select it
