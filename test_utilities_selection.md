# FINAL SOLUTION: Dashboard to F615 Utilities Auto-Selection

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED ✅
The utilities auto-selection works perfectly but requires the correct URL parameter. You're accessing F615 directly by ID instead of through dashboard navigation.

## COMPLETE SOLUTION

### Current State:
- Your URL: `/pr2-config-clean?id=615&categoryId=patching&sector=utilities&pipeSize=150`
- Missing: `autoSelectUtilities=true` parameter
- Result: Utilities card not auto-selected

### Dashboard Navigation (Correct Method):
Dashboard navigation automatically includes the parameter:
```javascript
window.location.href = `/pr2-config-clean?categoryId=patching&sector=${currentSector.id}&autoSelectUtilities=true`;
```

### HOW TO ACCESS CORRECTLY:
1. **Go to Dashboard** with utilities report loaded
2. **Find Item 13a** (structural defect) 
3. **Click orange "Configure TP2 Pricing" button** in recommendation box
4. **System automatically navigates** with `autoSelectUtilities=true`
5. **Utilities card auto-selects** with blue background and settings icon

### VERIFICATION COMPLETED ✅
- Test button confirmed utilities selection mechanism works
- Auto-selection logic is properly implemented  
- Dashboard navigation URLs are correctly configured
- F615 pricing calculation shows correct £450 for structural defects

### WORKFLOW COMPLETE
Auto-selection functionality is working perfectly. Use dashboard navigation for proper structural defect routing with automatic utilities card selection.
