# AUTHENTIC DATA EXTRACTION REQUEST

## Issue: Database File Corruption
All main Wincan database files are corrupted during upload ("file is not a database" error).
Only Meta.db3 works (contains client info: RG Structures Ltd).

## Current Status
- Fixed multer upload configuration to prevent future corruption
- Need authentic data from existing corrupted files to create proper dataset

## User Corrections Needed
You mentioned these corrections for the inspection data:

**Item 2:**
- Start MH: SW02 (confirmed)
- Length: 19.02m (corrected from my 18.2m)
- Observations: [Please provide correct observations]

**Item 3:**
- Length: 30.24m (corrected from my 22.4m) 
- Observations: [Please provide correct observations instead of fake DER data]

## Next Steps
1. User provides correct observations for items 2 and 3
2. Create complete authentic dataset with real values
3. Test upload with fresh database files (corruption should be fixed)
4. Implement proper Wincan database reader for future uploads

## Request
Can you provide the correct observation codes for items 2 and 3 from your actual database files?
