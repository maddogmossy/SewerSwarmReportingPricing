# Complete .99 Auto-Addition Workflow

## User Requirement
ALL purple length inputs must automatically get ".99" added for continuous range calculations - no exceptions.

## Current Problem
System is changing "3" to "3.99" when database already has "3.99", causing confusion.

## Complete Workflow Steps

### 1. User Types in Purple Length Field
- User types: "30"
- System should immediately convert to: "30.99"
- User types: "22.5" 
- System should immediately convert to: "22.99"

### 2. Logic Rules
```javascript
if (field === 'purpleLength' && value && value.trim() !== '') {
  // Rule 1: Whole numbers get .99 added
  if (/^\d+$/.test(value.trim())) {
    finalValue = value + '.99';
    console.log(`AUTO-ADDED .99 to whole number: "${value}" → "${finalValue}"`);
  }
  // Rule 2: Decimals get replaced with .99  
  else if (value.includes('.') && !value.endsWith('.99')) {
    const baseValue = value.split('.')[0];
    finalValue = baseValue + '.99';
    console.log(`REPLACED decimal with .99: "${value}" → "${finalValue}"`);
  }
  // Rule 3: Already has .99, keep as is
  else if (value.endsWith('.99')) {
    finalValue = value;
    console.log(`Already has .99: "${value}"`);
  }
}
```

### 3. Current Issue Analysis
- Database shows: `"purpleLength":"3.99"`
- Frontend localStorage shows: `"purpleLength":"3"`
- System keeps converting "3" to "3.99" repeatedly

### 4. Root Cause
Frontend and backend are out of sync. The auto-addition logic is running on stale frontend data.

### 5. Required Fix
```javascript
// Load backend data FIRST, then apply auto-addition only if needed
const backendValue = getCurrentBackendValue(rowId, field);
if (backendValue !== value) {
  // Only apply .99 logic if values don't match
  applyAutoAddition(value);
}
```

### 6. Files That Need This Logic
- `client/src/components/MMP1Template.tsx` - Line ~160
- `client/src/pages/pr2-config-clean.tsx` - Line ~1128

### 7. Testing Steps
1. Navigate to F606 configuration
2. Click on Purple Window (Length M)
3. Type "30" in first row
4. Should immediately show "30.99"
5. Save and reload page
6. Should still show "30.99" (not "30.9999")

### 8. Success Criteria
- Typing "30" becomes "30.99" immediately
- Typing "22.5" becomes "22.99" immediately  
- No duplicate .99 additions
- Values persist correctly after save/reload
- Range continuity maintained (0-30.99m, 30.99-60.99m, etc.)
