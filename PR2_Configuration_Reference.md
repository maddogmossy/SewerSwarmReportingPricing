## üóëÔ∏è Removed Duplicates
- Deleted 6 duplicate entries in invalid sectors (`id11`, `id2`, `id3`)
- Fixed P012 ‚Üí cctv mapping issue
- Standardized all descriptions

## Frontend Integration

### How DevLabels Work
- Each configuration gets a DevLabel like `F612`, `F690` etc.
- These appear in the UI for debugging/identification
- They correspond directly to the database ID (F612 = ID 612)

### Category ID Usage
The `category_id` field is the key used throughout the codebase:
- API endpoints use it for filtering
- Frontend components match against it
- Dashboard configuration selection uses it

### Missing Categories (Frontend Only)
These exist in frontend code but not in database yet:
- `ambient-lining` (F700+)
- `hot-cure-lining` (F700+)  
- `uv-lining` (F700+)
- `excavation` (F700+)
- `tankering` (F700+)

## Quick Reference for Debugging

When you see in logs:
- **F612** = CCTV configuration
- **F690** = CCTV/Jet Vac (most common)
- **F615** = Patching operations
- **F619** = Robotic cutting

When API calls fail, check:
1. Does `category_id` exist in database?
2. Does it match frontend `STANDARD_CATEGORIES`?
3. Is the sector correct (utilities/adoption/etc.)?
