# COMPLETE SERVICE VALIDATION BREAKDOWN

## CURRENT DATABASE STATE

### F606 Configuration (ID: 606) - CCTV Jet Vac
```json
{
  "mm4DataByPipeSize": {
    "150-1501": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "blueValue": "185", 
        "greenValue": "30",
        "purpleDebris": "30",
        "purpleLength": "99"  // YOU INCREASED THIS FROM 10m TO 99m
      }
      // Row 2 DELETED - only 1 row remains
    ]
  },
  "pricingOptions": [] // EMPTY - NO DAY RATE CONFIGURED
}
```

### F608 Configuration (ID: 608) - CCTV Van Pack  
```json
{
  "mm4DataByPipeSize": {
    "150-1501": null  // NO MM4 DATA CONFIGURED
  },
  "pricingOptions": [] // LIKELY HAS DAY RATE OF ¬£950
}
```

## SERVICE SECTIONS THAT SHOULD TRIGGER VALIDATION

### Item 6 - Service Section
- **Defects:** "DER Settled deposits, coarse, 5% cross-sectional area loss at 8.1m, 9.26m, 27.13m. Line deviates left at 33.34m"
- **Total Length:** ~33.34m (based on defects)
- **Pipe Size:** 150mm
- **Defect Type:** service
- **Requires Cleaning:** YES (contains 'DER')
- **Is Restricted Section:** YES (item 6 is in restricted list)

### Item 8 - Service Section  
- **Defects:** "DER Settled deposits, coarse, 5% cross-sectional area loss at 11.35m"
- **Total Length:** ~11.35m
- **Pipe Size:** 150mm
- **Defect Type:** service
- **Requires Cleaning:** YES (contains 'DER')
- **Is Restricted Section:** YES (item 8 is in restricted list)

## VALIDATION LOGIC ANALYSIS

### STEP 1: Equipment Priority Selection
- **Current Priority:** F606 (forced as default in testing)
- **Selected Config:** F606 (categoryId: 'cctv-jet-vac')

### STEP 2: Validation Trigger Conditions
```javascript
if (section.defectType === 'service' && pr2Configurations && pr2Configurations.length > 0) {
  const needsCleaning = requiresCleaning(section.defects || '');  // TRUE for items 6,8
  const isRestrictedSection = [3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23].includes(section.itemNo);  // TRUE for items 6,8
  
  if (needsCleaning && isRestrictedSection) {
    // VALIDATION SHOULD RUN HERE
  }
}
```

### STEP 3: MM4 Range Validation
```javascript
// F606 MM4 Data for 150mm pipe:
matchingMM4Data = [
  {
    id: 1,
    purpleLength: "99",    // 99m limit
    purpleDebris: "30"     // 30% debris limit  
  }
]

// Item 6: 33.34m length vs 99m limit = WITHIN RANGE ‚úì
// Item 8: 11.35m length vs 99m limit = WITHIN RANGE ‚úì
```

## THE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

### Issue 1: F606 Day Rate is EMPTY
- F606 has NO day rate configured (empty pricingOptions)
- With length now 99m, sections fit within MM4 ranges
- System proceeds to day rate validation which FAILS due to empty day rate
- **Result:** Should show orange triangle for missing day rate, NOT red cost

### Issue 2: Service Validation Not Triggering  
- **Missing Logs:** No "üîç SERVICE SECTION VALIDATION TRACE" in console
- **Missing Logs:** No "üîç EQUIPMENT PRIORITY DEBUG" for service sections
- **This indicates:** calculateAutoCost is NOT being called for service sections 6,8

### Issue 3: Cache Clearing Not Working
- Purple length was updated to 99m in database
- But sections still not triggering validation
- Cache clearing may not be reaching the right data

## EXPECTED BEHAVIOR VS ACTUAL

### What SHOULD Happen:
1. Item 6 (33.34m) and Item 8 (11.35m) both fit within F606 99m limit
2. F606 day rate is empty ‚Üí Orange triangle warning (day rate not configured)
3. Costs should show orange warning, not red

### What IS Happening:
1. Service sections not entering validation logic at all
2. No debugging output for service validation
3. Costs remain as calculated values, not warnings

## NEXT DEBUGGING STEPS NEEDED

1. **Verify calculateAutoCost is called** for service sections 6,8
2. **Check if pr2Configurations is properly loaded** 
3. **Trace why service validation logic is skipped**
4. **Confirm F606 day rate validation triggers orange warning**
