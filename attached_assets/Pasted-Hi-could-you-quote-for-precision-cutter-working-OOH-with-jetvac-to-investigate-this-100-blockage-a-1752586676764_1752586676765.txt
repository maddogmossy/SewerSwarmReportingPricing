Hi, could you quote for precision cutter working OOH with jetvac to investigate this 100% blockage at 30m U/S from CSO chamber to MH3682. (Approx 1m D/S from MH3682.) No evidence that our crew had a cutting jet on this, they may have been jetting into ragball/tarmac to get stuck rather than it being a collapse. The HA are concerned about our TM for Excavation hence the no dig request. GISST plan in mail below.
