My upload and dashboard aren't working. Please do all of the following:

---

ðŸ§  BACKEND FIXES

1. In `server/routes.ts`:
   - Ensure `/api/upload` uses `upload.any()` not `upload.single("file")`.
   - Fix field compatibility so both `file` and `files` field names are accepted from frontend.
   - Pass both `mainDbPath` and `metaDbPath` to `readWincanDatabase()` correctly, using `file.originalname.includes("_Meta")` to distinguish.
   - Log both filenames clearly during upload.

2. In `server/wincan-db-reader.ts`:
   - Ensure `readWincanDatabase(mainDbPath: string, metaDbPath?: string)` attaches Meta.db3 using:
     ```ts
     if (metaDbPath) {
       await db.exec(`ATTACH DATABASE '${metaDbPath}' AS metaDb`);
     }
     ```
   - Read `SECSTAT` table from **main** DB only:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM SECSTAT WHERE STA_Inspection_FK IS NOT NULL;
     ```
   - Fix SECOBS join column from `OBJ_Section_REF` â†’ `OBS_Section_REF` if necessary.

3. In `server/wincan-db-reader.ts`, make sure `MSCC5Classifier.classifyDefect()` is being called correctly (not `classifyObservation`).

ðŸ§© FRONTEND FIXES

4. In `client/src/components/folder-selector.tsx` (or wherever the upload form is):
   - Change the upload logic to use:
     ```ts
     formData.append("files", file)
     ```
     instead of `"file"` â€” or support both.

5. Fix CORS issues or `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` for:
   - `/api/pr2-clean`
   - `/api/folders`
   - `/api/work-categories`
   - `/api/vehicle-travel-rates`
   - `/api/uploads/:id/defects`
   Ensure all these endpoints are defined in backend and correctly routed in frontend query clients.

ðŸ§ª TEST CASE

6. Upload both of these files together (as you've done before):
   - `Gr7216 JLES Sheppards Way Rothley.db3`
   - `Gr7216 JLES Sheppards Way Rothley_Meta.db3`

   Then confirm:
   - SECSTAT data is loaded from main DB
   - STR and SER grades show in dashboard
   - PR2 Config, Work Categories, and Vehicle Rates all load without error

ðŸ’¬ FINALLY, Log to Console:
- "ðŸ“¥ Upload started for: [file names]"
- "âœ… DB3 parsed: [sections found]"
- "âœ… MetaDB attached: [status]"
- "ðŸ“Š SECSTAT: X STR, Y SER entries processed"
- "ðŸš€ Data available in dashboard"
