1. Tachograph Exemption for Jet-Vac Units – Emergency Drainage Work
Key Legislation:
Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 – governs driver hours and tachographs across EU and retained in UK post-Brexit.

UK Guidance: Department for Transport’s “EU drivers’ hours and tachograph rules for goods vehicles in the UK and Europe”

✅ Tachograph Exemption Clause:
Under Article 3(d) of EC 561/2006, vehicles are exempt where they are:

“used in emergencies or rescue operations.”

🔧 Interpretation for Jet-Vac Units:
If your jet vacs are used for:

Flood response

Pollution clearance

Emergency sewer unblocking

Gully emptying that prevents immediate road or property risk

Then you can legitimately rely on the emergency exemption.

However, for routine or scheduled maintenance (non-urgent gully sucking or planned sewer cleaning), the exemption does not apply. The intent and urgency matter.

✅ 2. Not Transporting Goods for Hire or Reward
Jet-vac units are not used for:

Delivering goods

Haulage for profit

Movement of products

So, they are not caught under the "carriage of goods for hire or reward" definitions that usually trigger tachograph and HGV compliance.

✅ 3. Driving on a Car Licence (Category B)
Jet-vac units may also be exempt from full HGV entitlement in limited cases.

✅ Exemption Reference:
If a vehicle is:

“classified as a special-purpose vehicle such as engineering plant, road construction, or agricultural machine (e.g. like a tractor),”
then Category B or even Category C1 (if 3.5t–7.5t) may suffice.

But — this only applies if:

The jet vac is registered as a "plant" vehicle, and

It’s used on roads only incidentally (e.g. to get between sites), not for commercial freight transport.

Many gully tankers or vacuum units fall under the engineering plant exemption – but this must be backed by how it’s registered and taxed (e.g. DVLA ‘plant’ class).

✅ Summary for Jane / HR / Insurers
Tachograph Exemption: Yes, for emergency drainage or flood work under EC 561/2006 Art 3(d). Not for routine maintenance.

Not transporting goods for sale: Correct – jet vacs carry waste/sludge, not saleable cargo.

Driving licence: Category B may suffice if the vehicle is taxed/registered as plant or engineering machinery, and weighs under 3.5t (or C1 for up to 7.5t). Anything heavier or used on-road commercially may require C1/C.
