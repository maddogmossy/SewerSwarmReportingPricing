# PDF Extraction Workflow - Complete Debug Analysis

## Current Problem: Upload 38 Deleted But PDF Reader Still References It

### Expected Workflow:
1. **File Upload** → Create record in `file_uploads` table with status="processing"
2. **PDF Parsing** → Extract text content using pdf-parse library  
3. **Pause Mode** (if checked) → Status="extracted_pending_review", store sections in `extractedData` JSON field
4. **PDF Reader Display** → Read from `extractedData` field and show in table
5. **Continue Processing** → Move data to `section_inspections` table, apply MSCC5 classification
6. **Dashboard Display** → Read from `section_inspections` table

### Current Broken State:
- Upload 38: DELETED ❌
- PDF Reader: Looking for Upload 38 ❌  
- Sections Endpoint: Returns `[]` because upload doesn't exist ❌
- Debug Shows: "sectionDataLength":0 ❌

### Required Fixes:

#### 1. Fix PDF Reader to Handle Missing Uploads
- Check if upload exists before trying to display
- Show error message if upload not found
- Redirect to upload page if no valid upload selected

#### 2. Fix Enhanced Extraction Function  
Current issues in `extractSectionInspectionData()`:
- Looking for "Section Item X:" patterns that don't exist in ECL format
- Fallback extraction not finding authentic data
- Debug output shows "no data recorded" for all fields
- Need to understand actual ECL PDF structure

#### 3. Fix Pause Workflow Storage
The pause workflow should:
- Extract sections using proper ECL format patterns
- Store enhanced sections with authentic dates/times/pipe specs
- Preserve project number and manhole references
- Enable proper PDF Reader display

### Next Steps:
1. Upload new ECL Newark file with pause checkbox
2. Check server logs for debug output from enhanced extraction
3. Fix extraction patterns based on actual PDF content
4. Verify sections stored in `extractedData` field properly
5. Confirm PDF Reader displays authentic data
